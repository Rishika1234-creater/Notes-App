##  JavaScript Concepts Covered

- DOM Manipulation (`getElementById`, `innerHTML`, `createElement`)  
- Event Handling (`onclick`)  
- Functions (`addNote()`, `deleteNote()`, `loadNotes()`)  
- Arrays (`push`, `splice`, `forEach`)  
- Template Literals (`` `...` `` for multi-line HTML)  
- Conditionals (`if/else`)  
- LocalStorage (`setItem`, `getItem`)  
- JSON (`stringify`, `parse`)

##  How It Works

1. **Add Note** – Type a note → Click "Add Note" → Saved in `localStorage` → Displayed on screen.  
2. **Delete Note** – Click delete → Removed from `localStorage` → UI updates automatically.  
3. **Load Notes** – On page load, notes are fetched from `localStorage` and displayed.
